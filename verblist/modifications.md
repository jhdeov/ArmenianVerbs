Minor notes on the verb list:
- Boyacioglu uses the morphological marker -ուլ (*-ul*) for Classes 21 and 22, but we use -նուլ (*-nul*).
- Some archaic verbs have unclear conjugations because the stem is vowel-final. But because they are archaic or obsolete, it is difficult to verify how they were conjugated.
- Some irregular verbs are optionally regularized in colloquial Western Armenian. This isn't noted in Boyacioglu 2010 or in our verb list.
- Boyacioglu 2010 provides a partial list of semantic features for the verbs. We are working on getting a complete list of features.
