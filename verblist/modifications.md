The verb list was taken from Boyacioglu 2010. However, we corrected minor errors in his verb list and reorganized some details. 
1) **Stems**: Boyacioglu 2010 doesn't explicitly state the stem of words. The stems are our own analysis. 
2) **Affixes**: Boyacioglu uses the morphological marker -ուլ (*-ul*) as the affix for Classes 21 and 22, but we use -նուլ (*-nul*).
3) **Subclass**: While still using Boyacioglu's class numbering, we set up subclasses for conjugations which slightly differ. For example, Classes 3 and 4 include both simple verbs and passive verbs. We set these two types of verbs apart.
3) **Typo**: Some verbs were incorrectly written without the final infinitival suffix `-l`. This includes աստիճանազրկե,
4) **Class**: Some verbs had the wrong conjugation class in Boyacioglu 2010. These errors were few and they are the following: յուսալ, ցօղուել, փտիլ, փառաբանել, ըմբոստանալ, նիհարնալ, ընծայուիլ, ընկերակցիլ, ընդունուիլ, ընձիւղել, ընձիւղիլ, ընտանենալ, ընտելանալ, նստեցնել, ստանձնել, ընկողմանիլ, քրտնիլ, դաւաճանել
5) **Causatives**: some causatives use an orthographic variant of the causative suffix. We set apart these verbs using a separate subclass based on orthography.
6) ***-anil* verbs**: Boyacioglu used separated classes (17, 18) for verbs that end in *-anil*. But these are conjugated the same as regular verbs in Class 3, 4 that end in *-il*. We reassign these verbs to Class 3, 4 and don't have a separate class for them.
7) **Class 26**: Classes 26 includes verbs with the suffix *-t͡ʃil* or the suffix *-il*. We reassign the verbs with *-il* into Class 44 because Class 44.
9) **Features**: Boyacioglu 2010 provides a partial list of semantic features for the verbs. We are working on getting a complete list of features.
10) **Archaic**: Boyacioglu listed paradigms for some archaic or obsolete verbs which are no longer used in modern spoken Armenian. We listed his paradigms for these archaic verbs, but it is possible that some archaic verbs differ in how they were inflected.
