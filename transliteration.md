# Transliteration of Armenian paradigms
Western Armenian is written in the Armenian script. There are many different transliteration [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Armenian) for Armenian, but most of them are geared to Eastern Armenian. They are not adequate for linguistic analysis. 

For this repo, I use a personal transliteration system. The transliteration was designed to simplify the description of paradigms. The transliterated form is similar to the pronunciation but not identical.

## Transliteration key
The table shows how orthgraphic characters are transliterated and pronounced, sometimes differently in special contexts. The transliterated character is similar to the pronounced IPA character.

|է|e|ɛ|
ի|i|i|
օ|o|ɔ|
ը|ə|ə|
ե|e|jɛ|word-initial

ո|vo|vɔ|word-initial
ո|o|ɔ|elsewhere
|ու |v|v|before vowel|
|ու |u|u|elsewhere|
|փ|p|pʰ|

## Notes
Armenian paradigms use the exclamation mark ՛   for imperatives: *կե՛ր* 'eat!'. This mark is placed on the verb's last vowel. The mark is shown in the transliteration: *ge՛r*.
 

The transliteration does not show the following phonological rules:
- the glide [j] is epenthesized before word-initial <ե>. This glide is ignored by the paradigm rules.
- a schwa is pronounced in consonant clusters but not shown in the orthography. The schwa does not affect the paradigm rules.
